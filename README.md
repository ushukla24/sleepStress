# sleepStress
Dataset:

I recommend not using this dataset for projects because it is generated.

Purpose: 

By asking how significant physical indicators are in helping us predict stress levels
and if we can use them to more accurately predict someone’s stress level, I attempt to
use physical indicators to predict a person’s stress level. Stress can lead to many
negative effects and if someone doesn’t understand how stressed they are then their
doctor might not be able to help them. This research could also provide a method to
measure the stress levels of non-verbal people and those who do not understand how
to quantify their stress. To do this I created a machine learning model that factors in
various physiological features observed while one is asleep as well as a stress level
reported by the patient.
